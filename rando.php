  <p>Cadet First Class Dennis P. Rando lost his life in a flight training accident on
September 30, 1996. He is the son of Paul and Toni Rando of East Bridgewater,
MA, and the brother of Denise Rando. Paul and Toni were members of the AF
Academy Cadet Parents' Association of Eastern Massachusetts. Dennis' Instructor
Pilot, Capt. Clay Smith, lost his life in the accident as well. Tragically, two
other cadets and their Air Force flight instructors also lost their lives in
separate flight trainer accidents at the Academy in 1995 - Cadet Mark Dostal and
his Instructor Pilot, Capt. Dan Fischer and in 1997 - Cadet Pace Weber and his
Instructor Pilot, Capt. Glenn Comeaux. (http://www.falconpride.com/t3/) Dennis
was an admirable and well-liked Cadet. Those who knew him were very impressed by
his friendliness, willingness to help others, generosity, and his compassion.
Dennis is described by many as "the epitome of a cadet." His passion was to fly.</p>

  <p>Former AFA Cadet Parents' Association of Eastern Massachusetts President, Bob
  Caggiano, founded the Rando Fund. Bob was inspired to create the Fund as a way
  to reimburse a number of Dennis' cadet classmates who came to Massachusetts to
  attend Dennis' funeral to serve as a cadet Honor Guard after learning that the
  cadets had traveled at their own personal expense. Bob would also learn that
  the Academy does not have the financial resources to provide for this type of
  travel for a cadet Honor Guard. The Massachusetts Association made an appeal
  to other cadet parents and Cadet Parents' Associations to help reimburse these
  cadets for their travel by making a donation. The response from across the
  country was overwhelming and more money that what was needed was donated. The
  Cadet Parents Club of Eastern Massachusetts then decided that fund raising to
  provide this type of travel was a most worthwhile endeavor for all cadets,
  their families and the AF Academy, as well as way to honor Dennis' memory. The
  Academy Superintendent at that time, General Paul Stein, recognized the value
  of this effort in support of the cadets and the Academy and worked to assist
  in the Rando Fund becoming a national fund raising initiative with a committee
  comprised of cadet parents and Cadet Parent Associations throughout the USA.
  The Air Force and the Academy fully supports the Fund and have officially
  recognized it and its mission. The Fund remains viable due to the continued
  donations of many individuals and the fund raising efforts of Parents'
  Associations from across the country. Since the Fund's inception,
  approximately $267,000 has been raised and spent in support of cadets and
  their families.</p>

  <p>The Fund's primary purpose is to help finance travel so that a group of about
  six cadets can attend the funeral services of a fellow cadet. The fund
  continually maintains a $10,000 reserve of its total assets for this purpose.
  Enabling the cadets to participate in the funeral service of a fellow cadet
  accomplishes two things. It helps cadets during an emotional time to say a
  final good-bye to their very close friend and it helps support the family
  involved when they see and meet a contingent of cadets who were closest to
  their son or daughter. The cadets also serve as the representatives of all
  other cadets and cadet families at the hometown services. Cadets are not asked
  to repay these funds. The funds are a gift made possible by the generous
  donations of people like you.</p>

  <p>All funds beyond the reserve are earmarked for humanitarian purposes such as
  enabling cadets of limited financial means to be able to travel home to attend
  the funeral services for a family member, close relative or close friend; or,
  to visit a very ill or seriously injured family member, close relative or
  friend based on the recommendations of a cadet's AOC, the Cadet Chaplain's
  Office or Commandant's Office. Cadet eligibility regarding necessity of
  travel, as well as determining the cadet's financial need is the
  responsibility of the Chaplain's Office. Not even the President of the Rando
  Fund is involved in that process. It has always been the opinion of the Fund's
  leadership that those decisions are best left to those most closely involved
  with the cadets and have the expertise necessary to determine a cadet's level
  of personal, emotional and financial need. Based on those recommendations, the
  Fund will subsidize the cost of the travel. The cadet and their family are not
  required to reimburse the fund. Again, these funds are a gift made possible by
  your donations.</p>

  <p>The Air Force Academy Superintendents, Commandants and Chaplains have
  continually expressed their support and appreciation of this Fund because it
  fills a void at the Academy that is not a part of their budget, nor is
  transportation for such situations offered through the Air Force. Many
  officials at the Academy continue to be impressed with the ability of the
  parents to organize and help the cadets at a time of emotional need. The
  letters of sincere appreciation received from families who have lost a cadet
  as well as the letters of thanks from cadets who have been able to attend the
  funeral of a fallen comrade or be at the bedside of critically ill family
  member or friend, speaks to the need for us to continue this most worthwhile
  work.</p>

  <p>The Fund supports any cadet in need, not just the cadets whose families or
  Parents' Associations have made contributions. The Rando Fund has no
  affiliation with any other fund raising groups or organizations and has no
  other missions other than to raise funds on behalf of cadets for the purposes
  stated above. 100% of every donation received goes into the Fund. The Fund has
  no paid staff nor does it have any expenses related to its operation. The cost
  of all expenses is donated.</p>

  <p>Thank you in advance for all that you will do to help make the Dennis P. Rando
  Cadet Humanitarian Fund a success and for your support of all cadets. We feel
  that it is the least we can do for our sons and daughters who have voluntarily
  committed themselves to the defense of our nation.</p>
