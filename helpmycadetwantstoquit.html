<P><font face="Baskerton" size="2">I really enjoy monitoring and contributing 
  to the USAFA Family Network and often save notes for inclusion in our local 
  newsletter or for forwarding to my cadet. The Network does really seem to be 
  a place where parents can come to share the triumphs and sorrows experienced 
  while sharing with their sons and daughters the <I>rollercoaster ride</I> that 
  is Camp USAFA.</font></P>
<FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">One of the best examples of how we can reachout to each other 
  and offer comfort occurred after I’d been on the Network for only a couple of 
  months (Fall of 1995). I was heartened by the kind responses from all over the 
  country to one mother’s plea concerning her Doolie cadet. I saved most of the 
  responses and collected them into this little booklet, thinking that some of 
  the parents in our Parents’ Club who are not on the Network might also enjoy 
  reading them. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">The notes in the booklet are not necessarily in the order received. 
  Some of the notes in this version did not appear in the original. The mother 
  that issued the initial plea sent me copies of notes that were sent directly 
  to her. I’ve grouped the notes by class (as they were in 1995) and noted where 
  the writer was from. (I also tried to delete most names.) The notes, except 
  for the deletions, are exactly as received, so forgive the writers’ their misspelled 
  words and other mistakes...they were writing from the heart.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">In this version, I’ve also included two writings from career 
  Air Force men that I saved from the Network. The notes were not in response 
  to the mother’s plea, but somehow, at least to me, seemed appropriate here.</font></P>

</font></u></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">What do I say to my cadet, class of ’99, who has become discouraged. 
  He claims that the education is no good, because he can’t learn when he doesn’t 
  get time to study or sleep. He thinks that there is no chance to take elective 
  classes to explore options for a major, that he doesn’t know what he wants to 
  be, etc. He always wanted to fly, but is no longer sure that it’s worth it to 
  him. He doesn’t want to have to "suck up to" superiors for the rest of his life. 
  Is he better off leaving or should I encourage him to stay? I’m confused.</font></P>

<FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">We know how you feel. We have a ’99 cadet there also. He has 
  called home before being upset and discouraged not knowing what to do nor having 
  his parents close to discuss his problems. We, as parents, do not know the type 
  or weight of the pressure placed upon our kids. All we can do is talk and listen. 
  When our cadet called we listened to him very carefully and then talked to him 
  Very Carefully. We told him that he was not the only cadet there that felt that 
  way. All he had to do was to look around him and see 1400 other ’99 cadets in 
  the boat as him. All we want to do is encourage them to stay. We would never 
  make our son stay. We did tell him to wait and see how he feels tomorrow. The 
  next day he was fine. He said he just had a bad day, not to worry he was fine. 
  Then a week or two later he is depressed again. We just go through encouragement 
  again. Never are we adamant that he has to stay. Mail him a letter of encouragement 
  everyday as long as it takes. Mail him a small package. Tell him you love him 
  but don’t tell him that you miss him, also tell him how proud that you are of 
  him. This seems to work with our son. Right now he is doing fine. Two weeks 
  ago he wanted to come home. Next week who knows. Take it one day at a time is 
  all we can say. Maybe someone else can help.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Good Luck (<I>MOM’s response</I>)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">My wife told me about your letter last night and I decided to 
  sleep upon a response. It is hard to advise you due to fact that I do not know 
  your son. I am not familiar with his attitudes nor his demeanor. But , I will 
  try. I raised <I>my son</I>, ’99 cadet, to be tough and hard. Along the way 
  between myself and my wife, his loving mother, we were able to osmosis tenderness 
  into him. The toughness was to prepare him for life after Mom and Dad. The tenderness 
  came out once he left for the Academy. I have considered myself to be a tough 
  man, impossible to be hurt; but, when <I>My son</I> got on that plane my heart 
  was heavy, very heavy, with pain. I knew that I would not be there when he needed 
  me. <I>My son</I>, knew that Mom and Dad would be 1,600 miles away and would 
  not be readily available with the pervious unwanted helping hand. We wrote <I>my 
  son</I> daily those first days until he got his computer and we obtained his 
  address. In those first days, <I>my son</I> would write home and you could sense 
  the pain he was feeling. <I>My son</I> was determined not to let us know that 
  he wanted out. He thought that this was what WE wanted for him. One day he delivered 
  his feelings to us almost in tears. And all we could do was listen very intently, 
  not interupting his thoughts and let him get it all lifted from his chest.One 
  of the first things I learned in sales many years ago is when a customer has 
  a problem let him talk until he is finished; then and only then, can you reason 
  with him. We have found that is the best way to handle <I>my son</I>. Alter 
  he has exposed all his hurt, you can take each problem on and discuss them out 
  in length. Alter <I>my son</I> has called and/or written about a bad day and 
  we have talked it over, within a few days we will hear from him and I will ask 
  him how he feels and he says that he is doing better. I have three sons and 
  one daughter. My intentions are to develo a feeling of strenght into each and 
  everyone. Built on a platform of love. Our three boys all play football. I told 
  each that this game IS NOT for everyone. It is rough and tough and you must 
  be the same to survive. We, also, told <I>my son</I> that the Academy was going 
  to very hard. We told him that before he dons the uniform be sure, very sure 
  that this is what he wants. I do not mean for that statement to sound cold; 
  but, we wanted <I>my son</I> to be sure of his decision before he left. It sounds 
  like your son has had some desire to attend the Academy and I hope it is a case 
  of homesickness. As my wife told you last night, All we can do is listen, talk, 
  discuss the problems and tell them that we LOVE them. Please contact us via 
  our e-main address NLashley@aol.com or</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I hope everything works for the best for your son, let us here 
  from you. Our heart goes out to you, for we have felt your pain. (<I>DAD’s response</I>)</font></P>
<I>
<P><font size="2">Later, there was this follow-up:</font></P>
</I>
<P><font size="2">Have you heard from Eric? My son called last night he seems 
  to be doing good right now. Go to Wal Mart or a card shop and pick up some encouragement 
  cards, they have nice verses. Some show love, some show humor but all show you 
  care. Some times it is hard to write a letter not knowing what to say to prevent 
  more homesickness because there is nothing really new to say; but, a card seems 
  to brighten his day. During basic, <I>my son </I>would write and say please 
  send snacks, candy,candy candy.......etc.So we went to Sams and got $160.00 
  worth of candy, cookies and other snacks and mailed it to him. He and his roommates 
  were shocked when they opened the package and said "a GOLD MINE ". He said they 
  were going to save it for when an upper cadet lets them us use his room so they 
  can watch TV and have a party.We are going to send a Halloween care/POW package 
  to <I>my son </I>next week. Have Erics friends write him. Tell his friends it 
  is very important that he receives encouraging mail or cards.If he likes to 
  play pool, then send him a poolstick. We sent <I>my son </I>2 sticks so he could 
  have a friend to play. They have pool tables there but no sticks.If he would 
  like to look up <I>my son </I>he is in Sq.12 Dirty Dozen, and in return I will 
  tell <I>my son </I>to look up Eric.I think it will do them both good because 
  it dosen’t hurt to have all the friends you can possibly have at this time.<I> 
  My son </I>and 4 of his friends rented a car last weekend. They went to town 
  just to ride around and to get a break away from everything.I have a brother 
  that lives close to you I think. They live in Belleview. He is Lt.Commander 
  David Deen.He said he is very proud of <I>my son </I>attending the Academy.So 
  is my father, they live in Georgia,my father retired from the Air Force after 
  23 yrs.<I> my son </I>has a great Uncle that flew troops on D Day, that just 
  past away last week.And he was very proud of <I>my son</I>. Does Eric have any 
  younger siblings? <I>my son </I>has 2 brothers and 1 sister. When <I>my son 
  </I>talks to them on the phone then he seems to get upset. After we realized 
  that it bothered him we don’t put the little ones on unless he ask for them. 
  Sorry to ramble from subject to subject but one seems to spark a comment in 
  another.It really bothers us a lot to hear about your son because we know what 
  you are dealing with. If we can be of further help then please E-Mail us,we 
  would like to hear how Eric is progressing.We hope he can make it through this.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">(<I>this is a combination of two notes from the same net source 
  - maybe mom and dad sent separate notes</I>)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Dear parent,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">These are hard times the cadets are going through and "sucking 
  up" ain’t lots of fun but believe it or not I think among all the "stuff" they 
  are having to put up with is a real lesson in taking orders and respecting authority 
  [something almost non-existant in this day and age] I know alot of it seems 
  silly, trite, and like college hassing, but I think if our young people don’t 
  give it a 100% shot and at least stick with it one year to see if it gets better, 
  they will have in the back of their minds a failure to measure up. It does take 
  the cream of the crop to get through this and my cadet in addition to not enjoying 
  all the riding their tails on everything is very homesick, but he is proud of 
  what he has gone through in bacic and grades so far and the pride of his airforce 
  uniform. If the were at a regular university it would be some studing but a 
  lot of party time and let it all hang out. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">I have seen a real grownth in my son and all growth is not easy, 
  unfortunately. I am sure there are some people that just can not hack it but 
  I would want to know I had encouraged my cadet to not give in too soon. There 
  are also soom wonderful officers out ther that could probably give you a male 
  military point of view. My prayers are with you.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Another concerned cadet Mom</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Dear concerned Mom,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I also have a cadet who is less than joyful about being a dooley, 
  but they never promised them a rose garden and this is aimed at making men and 
  women out of our little darlings. It’s hard to turn them loose and take some 
  of their knocks, but I have seen a growth in my son even though he is miserably 
  homesick. He is forced to study and is doing very well considering the tough 
  courses theyhave to take out there. If he were at a univeristy he would be spending 
  alot more time partying and in less regimented atmosphere. The guality of their 
  education out there is really wonderful-some say second to none. The pride my 
  son has had in finishing basic and learning the military ropes have matured 
  him in lots of ways. I think if I encourgaged him to gvie it up he may have 
  trouble with feelings of not being strong enough to do a man’s [or woman’s]job. 
  I want him to give it at least a year so he won’t feel a failure. Also as far 
  as a major is concerned, there’s time for that.Hang in there, love him, encourage 
  him and pray for him -that’s what we are doing. There are leaison[sp]officers 
  who can probably give good manly advice, mind was from the heart of a mom.</font></P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">——— and ——,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I think your son is experiencing every classical syndrome that 
  had been outlined for us prior to our children entering the AFA. It is expected 
  of ALL new cadets. What they are experiencing is maximum stress. That is what 
  a combat officer must be able to cope with in time of combat. Their life and 
  that of many soldiers under their command may someday depend on how they handle 
  stress and their ability to make too many decisions with too little imformation 
  in too short a period of time and with the lives of too many soldiers hanging 
  in the balance. It sounds cruel, but they are at the AFA to become military 
  leaders. As parents, we must also realize our children may be called on to defend 
  our country or that of our allies. There are some of us who will loose our children 
  in combat one day. Please don’t take this as doom and gloom, but it is the reality 
  of why they stress our children. They are tasked with more than they could ever 
  hope to accomplish. It then becomes their decision and problem to decide what 
  must get done and what can be accomplished. They are longer able to devote all 
  energy to academics and may have to settle for a 2.5 GPA. A scary thought for 
  these brilliant children of ours. It’s something many parents have trouble accepting 
  also.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">You mentioned your son felt he could get all As at another college. 
  No doubt about it. He is used to being first in academics, but can you remember 
  somewhere along the process, we were advised our brilliant children would become 
  average once they hit the academy. Most of the cadets are accustomed to being 
  first. Now they have to balance and accept the fact that this will probably 
  not be the case at the AFA. AND ... they must realize that it is OK not to be 
  first. They must strike a balance between academics, military and athletics. 
  That is something my son’s friends who are atending regular college do not have 
  to do. My son is aware they call home every night if they want, come home weekends, 
  if they feel lonely, still have mom and dad to help them at a moments notice. 
  We will not be with our children when they have to make military decisions somewhere 
  down the road. They are learning to be completely independent, yet still work 
  as a team. No one person can conquer the enemy or fly the space shuttle, but 
  as a team we overcome and fly to the moon. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">I beg your forgiveness for being so wordy and at times too graphic, 
  but I have a strong military background and can relate to the stress our children 
  are being put through. I think when your son comes home for Thanksgiving, you 
  will find he is no longer the little boy you sent off in June. He may not want 
  to go back after Thanksgiving break, but boot him out the door until Christmas, 
  then again until spring break, etc. until May 1999. Help him accept the fact 
  he does not have to be number one and you love him for what he is. Because he 
  put the papers aside, I think his chances of graduation are good. He has the 
  both of you, all of us and all his friends at the Academy. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">best wishes,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">being a cadet parent is tougher than I imagined !!!!</font></P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=2>
<P><font size="2">From Orlando, Fl</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">As a former cadet (’73) with a daughter there now in ’99, I 
  would say it is normal to want to quit. I probably thought about it every day 
  I was there during the first year. By the way, the first week after returning 
  from Christmas break is the worst. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Since I run an AF ROTC program, I can say that most college 
  students find that everything is not perfect when they get to college. They 
  determine that going back home to try to rekindle their lives that were so pleasant 
  in high school is the answer. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. Most 
  of their friends have moved on.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">If your cadet wants to quit, don’t fight it. But don’t encourage 
  him to quit either. One thing I’ve learned in this business is that a cadet 
  at the academy or in ROTC should make up there own minds. Parents need to provide 
  input, options, thoughts, opinions, but not decisions or threats. Be supportive, 
  but insure your cadet understands that departure from the Academy is a one time 
  option. I doubt that any cadet that voluntarily resigned ever returned when 
  they realized that maybe they goofed by reacting emotionally to a bad day or 
  bad week. The key should be—Do you still want to be an officer in the United 
  States Air Force?? If the answer is still "YES", then the cadet should strongly 
  consider remaining. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">At my ROTC detachment, I have a young lady who was in ’98, was 
  eliminated due to bad grades in the first year, and is trying to become an officer 
  through my program. She is a great new cadet, but I will have to get a waiver 
  for her to complete my program because she departed another commissioning program. 
  Hopefully, I will be successful.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Cheers.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">From Amity, OR</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">Something a little different than the other letters about Academy-weary 
  cadets. There is a book entitled The Air Force Academy Candidate Book by William 
  L. Smallwood, Beacon Books, ISBN 0-929311-03-5 that contains a number of chapters 
  with terrific advice about how to survive at the Academy. The author has interviewed 
  cadets, graduates, Doolies, upperclassmen, etc. for their advice on handling 
  the rigors of the Academy, so the reader gets the perspective of the cadet in 
  the middle of Doolie year and from those looking back at it and from those looking 
  at it from afar (the parents). Also included are chapters on special situations 
  like being a female cadet at the Academy and problems with roommates. There 
  is a lot of discussion about the complex application procedure for the Academy, 
  also. When our cadet was really discouraged (he is also a Doolie) at the beginning 
  of the academic year, we sent him photocopies of the appropriate chapters. We 
  also did all the other things the other parents have done. Listen to him, encourage 
  him not to make a permanent decision when he is exhausted, asked him to talk 
  to a chaplain or someone he could trust, etc. We don’t know if the reading the 
  chapters helped, but when I asked him this weekend during a phone call what 
  he felt about the Academy now, he answered, "Cool." I’m sure we have more down 
  times ahead, though.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Anyway, I highly recommend getting hold of a copy of that book. 
  It sure helped us understand the Academy life better and put us at ease about 
  a number of issues that are slightly frightening, like how the honor code actually 
  works. We bought our copy through our parents’ club, but I noticed some copies 
  for sale at the Arnold Hall gift shop during Parents’ Weekend.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Hope this helps. </font></P>

<P><font size="2">I just received the following e-mail from my son —— ’99. He 
  had an exceptionally tough week with some of the upper classmen ‘training’ last 
  week and was real down when we spoke to him over the weekend. I hope it can 
  add credability to all the supportive responses you received thus far. I think 
  every response was on target. The Academy is a tough place and you have to want 
  to be there. It is an experience in life. The harder you work ... the greater 
  the rewards. Everyone needs a support network of family, friends, counselors, 
  clergy and religion. We must make use of them all. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">If the military is for your son, then I pray he uses all the 
  support mechanisms available to help him over the same trauma every cadet that 
  has entered the Academy has undoubtedly gone through. Here is his letter:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Pop and mom, </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Thanks for the talk this weekend. It helped to pick me up. You 
  can really get down here and if you do it is a giant snowball effect which can 
  be extremely difficult to recover from. I think I am going to walk around the 
  terrazzo and take some pictures this week. Get some good ones of me and my friends 
  and this shithole. Funny thing is that I love it here. I get a big grin on my 
  face everytime I walk on the terrazzo and see this place and realize I am actually 
  here. I just hate the people I got stuck with. I have made some really good 
  friends though and we all support each other 100% We all get along really well 
  and make the most of what we have. A few of us are very close and do everything 
  together. It helps to all know they’re on my left side, while my father is on 
  my right, mother above (praying), and brother behind (pushing me with his jeep).</font></P>

<P><font size="2">... We will write &lt;the original mother&gt; a note of encouragement. 
  I think she needs to know that all the guys in CS14 are pulling for Eric. He

  <I>Our Cadet’s</I> message to us only said "no time tonight. We have non-mil

  to protect, encourage, and rebuild Eric. That is one strong support group they 
  have. When one "checks out" all suffer separation pain. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">I understand from <I>our cadet</I> that Eric has both high and 
  low times like all our cadets. What do you say? "Hang in there. The highs will

</font></I><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">Dear ——,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Just thought I would drop you a note to let you know of a connection 
  you may not have noticed on the USAFA list. My son is a C4C in CS14 with Eric. 
  I did not make the connection until <I>my son</I> mentioned speaking witha cadet 
  who changed his mind about quitting recently. So I emailed him about it for 
  details. It seems Eric’s roommate and John challenged Eric on what he would 
  do on his return home, for which he had no answer and set him to thinking. <I>My 
  son</I> does not know what impact they may have had in the whole picture and 
  gives most of the credit to Eric’s room mate. But they are encouraging him! 
  <I>My son</I> mentioned that Eric needs some help academically but did not say 
  if he was directly helping Eric. Feel free to suggest to Eric that he ask <I>my 
  son</I> for help. I know he would be willing to help and can help, especially 
  in the sciences. <I>My son</I> is doing very well academically.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I will be praying for Eric.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">——,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">You are welcome for the note. I was encouraged at my son’s response 
  as it communicated his concern for another cadet, but also his commitment to 
  USAFA and his course toward an AF career.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">What may be helping <I>my son</I> so much may be his perspective. 
  We talked at length before he left of what he should expect, and WHY. What is 
  the ultimate goal of USAFA? It is to produce Shawn O’Grady’s (the guy shot down 
  over Bosnia). An officer who will perform, thoughtfully and with discipline 
  under incredible stress. Life threatening stress. Every cadet there knows that 
  someday he may have one of those he is training as his wingman. Can he handle 
  the stress? Will he bail out and fly home when the flack starts flying? Or will 
  he stand firm in spite of his fear and with discipline and commitment to his 
  squadron fly on to complete the mission?</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The Air Force Academy is not a college. It’s purpose is not 
  to "point a kid in the right direction" or help him "find himself" or "broaden 
  his horizons" or even "prepare him for a career in industry." No, the academy 
  trains men to take on the most serious challenge of life, to defend all of us 
  from the basic evil that is in all mankind. So the training is designed to prepare 
  men to meet that kind of challenge. But it seems so "mickey mouse", so arbitrary, 
  so unnecessary!! Maybe. But look at the result. Look at the men who have gone 
  before who have gone through the same mickey mouse stuff. And include in that 
  list the men of Army and Navy. The men standing on beaches and on ships with 
  smoke and death around them who hear first then look with tears in their eyes 
  at the F16’s thundering past low and fast into the face of an awful enemy, and 
  say in their hearts "I KNEW they’d come!" That is not a romantic movie. That 
  is the reality of a fallen world that requires our diligence, and the diligence 
  of our sons and daughters.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">So why are they there? To prepare for the worst case. The most 
  stressful case. The most important case. To prepare for the most difficult task 
  known to mankind. So is the training to be compared to some other college? I 
  think not. Is the result to be compared to another college? Definitely not. 
  What our sons and daughters can expect is to graduate with a confidence that 
  is found only in the most purposeful of civilian graduates. And, a confidence 
  IN THEM by those around them born of the respect created by those who have gone 
  before them. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">So suggest to your son that he look behind the eyes of that 
  upper class cadet screaming at him from a nose length away, and remember that 
  someday that very same cadet may risk or even lose his life for him. Perhaps 
  scrubbing the window runners with a tooth brush and swabs may seem a little 
  smaller in comparison.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">God bless,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I have read with interest the interchanges regarding dropout 
  rates at the academy. I am interested too, just to see how "we" are doing, but 
  I am not concerned. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Only about 50% of the entering freshmen at non-military, four 
  year institutions will graduate from THAT institution within 5 years. Given 
  that statistic, even the class of 98 down to about 800 is only approaching "normal" 
  while all the other classes are extraordinary for the level of commitment and 
  perseverance shown by the cadet corps. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Don’t misinterpret: I care a great deal for those who leave. 
  But I cannot say to them, "you are missing a great opportunity." For them it 
  may be very wrong. Consider the quality of the kid that quits: top of his class, 
  a giver of his/her time in after school activities, a model many other parents 
  would love to have their children follow. He or she may wind up as the head 
  of an engineering firm that designs the future planes our kids fly! My concern 
  for them is the turmoil they go through as they reorient to a new objective. 
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Let us continue to encourage them. If you know of any who quietly 
  slip away from our network, drop them an email, and if appropriate let others 
  know so that we can encourage them too. </font></P>

<P><font size="2">I’ve read a lot of the support mail that has been sent to you 
  and it’s all great advice, I have a daughter in the class of 98', and I just 
  wanted to add that at the beginning of her freshan year she was unsure wheather 
  she wanted to stay and put up with all that was being dished out, from day one 
  we have told her that we would stand by her no matter what her decision would 
  be, she made it through last year and last month when we visited her at parents 
  weekend she told us that she is so happy to be there, she is now sure she made 
  the right decision and she knows that the education she is receiving at the 
  Academy is not comparable to any other university. So, as all the other parents 
  have suggested keep supporting your cadet, keep those letters and cards and 
  packages going out to him and if it is meant to be he will make it through! 
  Please write back and let us know how both of you are doing. P.S. Have him talk 
  to a chaplain, coach or anyone he feels comfortable talking too, it helps. A 
  few prayers help too! We feel for you, good luck.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Almost ALL Doolies go through this, as far as not wanting to 
  ‘suck up’ to superiors all his life......That is LIFE, whether in the service 
  or in the business world. Encourage him to try and stick it out the first year, 
  the second year is MUCH different. My son is now a C3C and is MUCH happier than 
  his Doolie year. This ‘n that still suck (cadets favorite term) but overall 
  its a lot more fun. Good Luck, and IT IS WORTH IT. I also had a friend of mine

  an F-4 to F-16. He now flys for American.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">I have a daughter in her 2nd year at the Academy who has very 
  ambivalent feelings about staying at the Academy. She hated Basic and wantedto 
  quit as soon as it was over. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Then she started volleyball and decided that she would take 
  it one day at a time. After Christmas, her roommate left and my daughter decided 
  to leave too. However after telling her coach and her teachers, she got such 
  tremendous pressure to stay that she felt she just couldn’t leave. She made 
  it through to the summer and had a tremendous time during the summer. She loved 
  the survival training and soaring. She also had a great social life and didn’t 
  want to come home for her 3 week leave. She did come home later than she could 
  have and tried to talk her brother into going to the Academy. Well, when she 
  got back to the Academy a lot of personal things happened that made her very 
  unhappy and the night your message came through <I>my daughter</I> called and 
  was crying. She said she hated the Academy and wanted to leave but was afraid 
  to quit. We have always told her that she has to make the decision and we will 
  support her in whatever decision she makes. She called back later and said that 
  she was going to leave at Christmas. Three days later she called and said that 
  she had leased a horse for 3 months and maybe she might stay until June.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">As of now I have no idea what she will do. <I>My daughter</I> 
  is the middle hitter for the volleyball team and without volleyball I know she 
  would not still be there. She joined the ski club in the winter and went to 
  Vail and several other place which helped her get through the winter months. 
  Now she has this horse.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">My daughter has the same complaints as your son. The cadets 
  are always exhausted and really have little time to study. They take more courses 
  than kids at a regular school and the Academy has not heard of grade inflation. 
  It really does not seem like an ideal learning environment. <I>My daughter</I> 
  is in aerospace eng. and now is questioning whether she wants to do that. However 
  because the cadets have to graduate in 4 years they do not have the opportunity 
  to explore other options.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">My husband and I feel that <I>my daughter</I> could be getting 
  straight A’s if she were at a regular school because she would have time to 
  study and also time to goof around. However with her volleyball, and military 
  training she has little time to relax and she admitted that last year she never 
  did her homework or studied. Consequently, her grades were not as good as we 
  would have liked them to be. Tara did not want to use the little free time she 
  had to study.</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><I>My daughter</i> had a lot of options, as most of the cadets 
  did. Harvard flew her out to play volleyball and she had scholarships at lots 
  of schools. She had always dreamed about going to the Academy and would not 
  consider anything else. I think because she realizes that was a mistake she 
  cannot trust her decision about quitting. She is so afraid she will make another 
  mistake. We have tried to reassure her that if she quits she can still have 
  a successful life and be happy.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">As you can probably gather, we have been riding this emotional 
  rollercoaster for a year and a half. I’m not sure if I can continue on like 
  this for another two and a half years. I wish I knew what was best for her.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">We sent her all those letters of response you received and she 
  said she would rather have heard from cadets who had quit and how they were 
  feeling. I hope your son does give the Academy a little more time. Then, if 
  he leaves he will know that he gave it a chance.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Good luck and please write if you have any questions or just 
  need to vent your frustrations. I understand what you are going through. If 
  your son is not involved in an extracurricular activity, encourage him to do 
  find one. For most cadets this is a lifesaver.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I better end this now. I am sorry this message got so long. 
  I have so many frustrations about the Academy it is hard to be brief. Let me 
  know how your son is doing,</font></P>

  year is horrid, as much for parents and all family members (even including your

  it but it wasn’t until the end of the summer that we really knew he was going 
  to make it to his C3C year. and...it wasn’t until last week that his attitude 
  improved immensely as he made the baseball team, stayed academically qualified 
  and got grassroots all in one week. It has been quite an experience for us all

<P><font size="2">Hi, ... As most parent’s of cadets I know what it is you are 
  going through. This is one of many reasons I have enjoyed the USAFAnet, parents 
  need support too!!!</font></P>
<P><font size="2">In regard to your concerns, I can only relate personel feelings 
  from <I>my daughter</I> and from an academy grad &lt;<I>myself</I>&gt;. First, 
  <I>my daughter</I> has said on many occasions that although the first semester 
  was not a lot of fun, things did get better the next semester. The following 
  summer things improved dramatically, soph. year went more smoothly, third summer 
  was great, this fall when we visited her for her 21st birthday, she said out 
  of the blue, "I cann’t tell you how glad I am to be here!" Things do improve 
  and probably the best thing you can do for your cadet is to listen patiently 
  and let him work out his frustations. Ask him to give the academy a fair chance, 
  at least a full semester—better yet a full year. After recognition things really 
  change.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">My academy graduate friend went through much the same as your 
  cadet and his parents the same as you. He really wanted out about Thanksgiving 
  time, could not see himself even going the full semester, his father asked him 
  to stay through the first of the year and then make up his mind. Even though 
  the return after Christmas was a killer, he stayed, went through recognition, 
  the next summer and so forth. Got a graduate school slot, went back and taught, 
  and completed his comittment plus. He is how president and CEO of a local laser 
  company.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Please be patient but firm with your cadet. Even if he does 
  decide that leaving is the best route for him, the experiences which he has 
  already gained will mold him ever in a positive direction.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Having just joined USAFAnet I’m a little late getting into the 
  problems of Eric and his wanting to leave the academy, but I thought I’d write 
  anyway and let you know how our son made it through his first year.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Like Eric, <I>my son</I> wasn’t exactly having a fun time his 
  first semester. Fortunately, he was not having trouble with academics, and in 
  fact just missed getting a 4.0. However, those grades came at the cost of lots 
  of lost sleep and frustration. As a C4C you learn to sleep almost any place 
  and at any time...</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><I>My son</i> was lucky that he was able to come home for his 
  HS Homecoming. He used his one weekend pass and flew in on Friday and went back 
  Sunday. It was a short visit, but worth it in the long run. He seemed pretty 
  "up" during that visit. Thanksgiving was a different story. He was really excited 
  to be home the first couple of days, but as he spent more time with his HS buddies, 
  I think he started feeling sorry for himself. By the time it came to go to the 
  airport he didn’t want to go back. Cadets need to realize that during leave 
  their friends will tell them stories about all the great fun they are having 
  at college and it will make them feel bad about being stuck at the academy. 
  Let’s face it. Cadets are not at the academy to have fun their first year. Sure, 
  there are fun times, but it’s not your typical "party school" and they need 
  to realize that. If they can keep that in perspective it will make life a lot 
  easier.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Christmas break for <I>my son</I> was about the same. Nice to 
  be home, but not wanting to go back at the end of leave. Through all of this 
  the one saving thing was having e-mail. For a freshman cadet at the academy, 
  this is the one thing that helped keep him sane. He wrote us every day at work 
  or at home. It was a way to boost his spirits when he was down.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Being down on the academy is nothing new. lmost all cadets are 
  at one time or another. A good friend of ours from our high school and Washington 
  parents association graduated this year. When he was a first semester C3C he 
  wanted to quit and told his parents he was leaving. He re-thought his position 
  and decided to stick it out. He’s so glad he did. He went on to become squadron 
  commander this past year and will be starting UPT in November! Having him at 
  the academy was a godsend to <I>my son</I> since he acted like his big brother.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Just tell Eric there is life after your fourth class year! Each 
  year gets a bit better, although most cadets will say the thirdclass year is 
  one of the toughest academically. Each year brings different kinds of stress, 
  but that is what makes these kids men. This year <I>my son</I> is having a very 
  good year since he’s doing what he likes, flying as a Soaring IP. Of course 
  it also helps to have his stereo, refrigerator, and car next Spring. When he 
  looks back on his first year he says he tended to take things MUCH too seriously. 
  Eric needs to realize that a lot of what goes on at the academy is just a game 
  of wits. However, he also needs to realize he needs to study and keep his grades 
  up. This is important! Eric sound like the type of kid that likes to have a 
  good time. <I>my son</I> does also. But he also realizes there is a time and 
  place for fun, and there is a time and place to be serious. The key phrase is 
  "play the game." Do what is required to get through. It doesn’t matter if you 
  believe what you are required to do is dumb or not. I remember <I>my son</I> 
  getting so upset about having to polish the floor, or woodwork or something. 
  Anyway, it really bothered him. But now he says, "big deal."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">A couple of years from now, Eric will look back at his freshman 
  year and also say "big deal." Take it one day at a time and don’t give up and 
  pretty soon he will be through it before he knows it. And that’s that.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">I never thought my son would suggest leaving but maybe I don’t 
  know my son very well. I do know the Academy and the skills needed for success. 
  I am now a practicing father with much to learn. My cadet is solving some of 
  the most difficult lessons of life and I’m happy for him. <I>His mother</I> 
  solved a problem one day as only mothers can. Our cadet was having difficulties 
  and we heard discouragement on the phone. My wife’s answer, "—— is not getting 
  enough sleep, he gets this way without sleep." I heard the problem and was preparing 
  a dissertation and Mom heard a cadet needing sleep. Do any of you have unique 
  ways to deal your cadets feedback?</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Hi ——:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I bet <I>mom (above)</I> is right ——— needs sleep. Sometimes 
  you just need to listen to your Cadet, they really are not looking for answers. 
  I sometimes wonder if they just need to know you will be there for them should 
  they decide this is not for them. I think in most cases once they receive the 
  encouragement, and after some sleep they are ready again. The weekend is coming.

<P><font size="2">Dear -----,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Just read your powerful note with your questions about staying 
  at the AFA. The pressures on the kids can’t be underestimated. I don’t think 
  there is anyone at the Academy who hasn’t thought about leaving. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">The lack of sleep can be the biggest ‘stresser." With the win 
  over Navy today, maybe the class of ’99 will be given a week at rest. This will 
  give Erik some time with less presssure to consider his options. The academy 
  is not the best place for everyone. The cadets are asked to make great sacrifices 
  with few immediate rewards. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">We all want our children to make the best choice to achieve 
  their goals. If Erik is greatly unhappy he might consider talking to the chaplain. 
  Even if Erik is not religious, the chaplain has great resources and experience 
  with cadets with questions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Please feel free to call us. We are thinking of you. It is as 
  hard to be a parent as it is a cadet, it’s just different. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">One of the more difficult things for our cadet to really understand 
  in the first year was that the military side fo things in fact does count.....even 
  if tha cadet has experienced a measure of success at "blowing off" a lot of 
  it. It is a military institution, which at the outset not only does not foster 
  individual thinking, but takes great pains to reduce everyone to a common denominator. 
  The opportunity for your cadet to"grow" in this envirement will come later.....ususally 
  not in the first year. One of the things Erik might want to consider is that 
  he was selected for this experience, BECAUSE THE AFA FELT HE COULD GET THROUGH 
  IT. WE would welcome the chance to talk with you..........cheers</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Here is an article We found in PENPAGES regarding listening 
  skills. PENPAGES is an online library (database) maintained by the Univ. of 
  Penn. It was originally written for child care providers when communicating 
  with parents, but we modified it to relate to our academy exprience. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">LISTENING WELL PROMOTES GOOD RELATIONSHIPS </font></P>
<P><font size="2">by Christiann Dean, Dept. of Human Development and Family Studies, 
  New York State College of Human Ecology, Cornell</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Can you remember a time when someone really listened to you? 
  Whether your conversation took place in a quiet, protected setting or in the 
  hustle of a busy public place, the other person gave you the kind of attention 
  that made you feel you were the only two people in the universe. You felt your 
  listener’s openness to your concerns or ideas—to you. Your listener conveyed 
  a genuine understanding of what you were saying. You felt heard, understood.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">If you’ve been lucky enough to have had even one such experience, 
  you know that listening well has a remarkable way of melting barriers, even 
  in the face of frustration, confusion, anger, or grief. Good listeners have 
  a way of making everyone feel like a friend. Such listening is a rarity. Few 
  people have had any training or even good role models in listening well. With 
  practice, most people can become highly skilled listeners, quietly opening the 
  doors to better relationships at work and at home.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">CONVEYING OPENNESS AND ATTENTION</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Listening requires openness, attention, and acknowledgment of 
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2">what the other person is trying to tell you. To listen well, 
  you need to convey that you are open to the other’s point of view and are "right 
  there" with him or her.(Openness does not necessarily mean you agree with another 
  viewpoint, but that you are open to hearing it.) Try any of these "communication 
  helpers" to open the lines of communication: </font></P>
<P><font size="2">1.Door openers are invitations to talk, letting the other person 
  decide whether to proceed ("Want to talk about it?" "You sound sad. Is something 
  bothering you?") </font></P>
<P><font size="2">2.Encouragers ("I’d like to hear more about your concerns.") 
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2">3.Open questions ("What do you hope to gain by dropping out?"). 
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2">You can arrange to create a "zone of attention" around yourself 
  and the person you’re listening to, conveying with eye contact and body language 
  that you are deeply engaged and not open to interruptions. Sometimes you may 
  need to set up another time (soon!) to talk in greater depth, either in person 
  or on the phone. It is difficult, but not impossible to create a "listening" 
  environment through e-mail and letters.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">THREE TYPES OF FEEDBACK</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Perhaps the most important (and too often overlooked) step in 
  successful communication is acknowledging that you’ve heard what is being said, 
  through "feedback". Feedback is most successful when tailored to match the speaker’s 
  emphasis, using factual, emotional, or solution-focused feedback depending on 
  the situation.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Here are examples of the three types of feedback you could give 
  if your cadet is complaining about school. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">1.Factual:"So, you aren’t able to find time to study because 
  you have so many other things to do."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">2.Emotional:"I understand that you feel bad about not being 
  able to study today. You take pride in keeping up with your classes."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">3.Solution-focused:"All kinds of things went wrong this week 
  for you . Luckily you have a long weekend coming up and Thanksgiving will be 
  here before you know it. We can set aside time for you to study here at home 
  in your old room."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Often it works well to use two or three types of feedback. Try 
  to match your cadet’s tone. For example, if your son or daughter expresses strong 
  emotion, use emotional feedback first. If the exchange is more factual, give 
  factual feedback. Note: Moving immediately to solution-focused feedback (before 
  making sure you understand the facts and feelings) is usually a mistake. Most 
  people need to be heard before movingon to solutions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">AVOID GIVING ADVICE (without being asked for it)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Once you understand what your child is saying and have acknowledged 
  that you understand, you might feel as though you should give some advice. Yet 
  giving unasked-for advice usually blocks communication instead of helping. Instead, 
  try offering information on available resources ("I heard that there is some 
  excellent tutoring help at the Academy. Do you think that might be a way for 
  you to better understand those areas where you are struggling?"). And using 
  open-ended questions ("What do you think might work?"). That way, the solution 
  is the cadet’s own, and more likely to stick. And he or she will know you cared 
  enough to listen well! </font></P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">I just spent 20 minutes reading the MANY concerned and sincere 
  responses from other cadet parents and previous academy grads regarding your 
  request for advice.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">One more will make not a wit of difference, but I’ll feel better 
  having given one additional perspective. I speak as the parent of a "firstie" 
  who went down the same familiar trail of concern back in the "doolie" days, 
  and the USAFA Prep School the year prior to that. Our son was packed up to head 
  for the airport the following day, in the midst of finishing his out-processing 
  paperwork. His mother and I had been careful to be supportive but firm in the 
  need for <I>our son</I> to make his own decision but not to be impulsive and 
  do something he would later regret. It seemed at the time, however, that we 
  had used up all the options: We had him talk to the chaplain, his football coach, 
  his AOC, his local off-base sponsor family (they made a BIG and positive difference) 
  and some of his upperclass buddies on the football team. All of that was to 
  no avail..up to that point. Then, I phoned him one last time during that out-processing 
  phase. I asked him what his plans were when he got back home. He was planning 
  to make inquires to go to Rice here in Houston. I had already checked and knew 
  that there was no way to start classes until late January when the 2nd semester 
  kickoff. He was going to be returning to Houston in mid October, right about 
  this time of year, come to think of it. At that point I suggested he at least 
  wait uptil Thanksgiving break and think about the full semester of course credit 
  he would be losing by not finishing the USAFA semester. For whatever reason, 
  he bought that idea, cancelled his out-processing...and the rest is history. 
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2"><I>Our son</i> finished T-3 training last summer and has been 
  advised that the prospect of a UPT slot will be forthcoming after graduation 
  on May 29. He is really enjoying the academy, finally, and so glad he did decide 
  to "give it another go". Riding bulls for the Academy Rodeo Team is one of his 
  favorite things these days. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">By the way, our son is one of those firsties that understands 
  the need for the controlled "training" that doolies receive but genuinely detested 
  any of his peers or subordinates that seem to derive pure pleasure from "dishing 
  it out" in excess. I would invite your son to contact mine (on the in-house 
  net or in person) for some one-on-one counselling if you think that approach 
  might be helpful. Let me know if that option sounds workable and I’ll advise 
  my cadet accordingly.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Here’s more encouragement from the Mom of a cadet that will 
  actually graduate this year. I had heard parent’s of Seniors could attend classes 
  with their cadet during parent’s weekend. I don’t know what the actual policy 
  is on this. Last year my son was taking mostly senior classes so I was able 
  to visit his classes Thursday and Friday. He was a little embarrassed about 
  my coming but I encouraged him to just ask his instructors and they were all 
  receptive. Frankly prior to my visiting his classes I didn’t have the the highest 
  opinion of the academics at the Academy. I had felt my son could have really 
  gotten a better education elsewhere and that there was a lot of hype about the 
  academics at the AFA. I never mentioned this to my cadet however. So I went 
  last year and was impressed no end how incredible the classes were. I was a 
  math and engineering major in college and grad school and I NEVER had such fabulous 
  teachers. In one of my son’s engineering classes the instructor was so attentive 
  to each student in his class.... the ones that were moving along light years 
  ahead of the rest... he took their input.. made a note of it on the board... 
  and said let’s work on how he got there and see if we agree.... for those who 
  were having trouble keeping up. he said ok.. who have I lost and where. .. and 
  they actually spoke up. Everyone left that class knowing the material and having 
  contributed to getting to the end result. I went to a Philosophy class that 
  was brilliant and funny and and relevant. I also saw a softer side of the cadets 
  as they interacted with one another. This year I went to classes again and was 
  trul astounded. In an engineering class they are to do a community service project 
  as though it was a launch to the moon. I can’t tell you how impressed I was 
  with the intercommunication that was going on among the cadets. Cooperation 
  like I’ve never witnessed, such confidence in asking someone to be responsible 
  for a part of the project with no question that they would actually get it done 
  as needed by a certain date, cadets volunteering to take on extra work (like 
  putting together a pert chart) because it would make it all run smoother.. this 
  was all done with the instructor out of the room. And when they got ready to 
  do the presentation all the buzzing in the room stopped instantly and they had 
  very encouraging and helpful remarks. This is all to say that the freshman don’t 
  get all this wonderful flow in the classroom like they will experience when 
  they are upperclassman. It is excellent and wonderful what is happening with 
  the academics I have seen and experienced first hand. And Prayer Works. I love 
  this support among parents because often your cadet will be on a "new Page" 
  while your still grieving over his last hardship and actually it’s the parent 
  needing the comfort as much as the child! I also found during my son’s most 
  difficult days- those were the ones when he was most dependent on the Lord and 
  I had new attitude about his trials. Not long till Thanksgiving. :)</font></P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">By now, hopefully, your cadet is feeling better about the AFA.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I has been great to see all of the support coming over the USAFAnet. 
  The words from the past AFA graduates was especially enlightening. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Our son also seriously wanted to quit during his first year 
  (only once that we found out about, probably many more times that we didn’t 
  know about). After a lot of prodding from us, he finally talked it out with 
  a priest at the Cadet Chapel, and with his AOC, and before you know it, he had 
  decided to try it a little longer. And like so many others we’ve heard from, 
  our cadet is now SO glad that he stayed! He’s said that many times!</font></P>
<P><font size="2">If your cadet continues to be down, encourage him cadet to start 
  talking to someone about his feelings. Those people out there are trained to 
  handle just this circumstance, and believe me, they are great! They won’t let 
  him quit easy. They will find out if this is really what he wants to do.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">And finally, if he does decide to quit, don’t let him think 
  for one second that he’s filed in any way. The military is simply not for everyone, 
  and he may be one of those people. But he hasn’t failed. He has already proven, 
  beyond any doubt, what exceptional talents he has, simply be getting into the 
  Academy in the first place.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">One of our son’s best friends during BCT and the first semester 
  of his freshman year ended up qetting out, but that young man is now doing very 
  well in a civilian college. If your son eventually does get out, all you can 
  do is be supportive and try to make the transition as smooth as possible for 
  him. He will be going through a traumatic experience and will need your support.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Best wishes,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">P.S. At our very first parent’s club meeting, one of the parents 
  of an upperclassman mentioned how they had sent their cadet inspirational/encouraging 
  quotes during their freshman year. So we did that too, on a daily basis, at 
  first with postcards during BCT, and then via e-mail after he got his computer. 
  In hindsight, Dave has told us that those daily quotes meant a lot to him. I 
  will post on the USAFAnet and text file of some of the quotes we found (I kept 
  a log so I wouldn’t repeat any of them). Maybe someone else can get some good 
  out of them.</font></P>

</font></B>
<P><font face="Baskerton" size="2"><I>We</i> are Presidents of the <I>local</I> 
  AFA parents club. We got involved due to another parental misconception of ours. 
  You see, <I>our son</I> had announced in second grade that he was going to the 
  Air Force Academy and would become a fighter pilot. He structured his whole 
  life towards that goal. He even turned down a full Navy scholarship to Penn 
  State and spent a year at Valley Forge Military Academy after high school. Due 
  to the cut backs in enrollment, and the fact that he was only 17, the Academy 
  Falcon Foundation underwrote that extra year with the promise that he would 
  be admitted if he did. Scott enjoyed the expeience of Military school and excelled 
  to a point where he was a company commander and spokesperson. Thus, when he 
  finally got to AFA, and the other parents told us that he would become disillusioned 
  and frequently think of leaving, we smiled and though "not Our son".</font></P>
<FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">When we were faced with a Doolie who was quite depressed and 
  even considered suicide, we were in shock. We turned to the other AFA parents 
  and got support, information and guidance that enabled us to help Scott in ways 
  that were appropriate without being too interfering. This was to be a recurring 
  theme. He no longer got got that depressed again, but there is a constant undercurrent 
  of "what if" throughout the Academy experience. <I>Our son</I> is now a "Firsty" 
  and ranking cadet. He has just completed T-3 pilot training and has his wings. 
  He is waiting to get a slot in military flight school (UPT) after graduation 
  and has been offered the job of Officer in Charge of the AFA mountaineering 
  club after graduation while he waits. He is planning to use the fact that pilots 
  get special treatment to go to law school. If so, he will have logged so much 
  time that he feels he will stay in until 20 year retirement. Such are the changes 
  and varieties of the Academy experience. What Eric is experiencing is common 
  and can be dealt with. The important thing to do is to remind him that this 
  is his life and he does have the option of changing routes on the way to his 
  own goal. We, as parents, must let them know that our love and pride is not 
  conditional on a single accomplishment or pathway. The Academies are a "Super 
  Bowl" of college placement. The fact that they have made it sets them apart. 
  If they choose to leave the team and play another sport or for another team, 
  we still remain their fans and will cheer them on. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Remember, he will share his frustrations with you because he 
  doesn’t think he has any other outlets. He is affraid he is or will be thought 
  of as a quitter. He, and you must realize that this is a UNIVERSAL thought among 
  all cadets. He is not alone. It is also O.K. to vent his frustration and concerns 
  with you. ... Should you wish to share any of this with Eric, it’s fine with 
  us...we’ve done it many times before...and it’s a way of paying those back who 
  did it for us.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">The main thing is to LISTEN! Every cadet goes through periods 
  of ups and downs. You will learn to ride "the rapids" Remember you are the only 
  link to their previous life styles. My daughter graduated in 1994 and is on 
  her first assignment. As the periods of depression reduced as she went on with 
  the training, the will to become an officer got stronger. We found one of the 
  tricks was to send funny greeting cards after a tearfuf conversation. The friendships 
  they form the first year will be there later in life Perhaps you noticed the 
  maturity your son had gained when you met him at parents weekend. He’ll be fine 
  ! support him and above all, LISTEN! Your bird has made his first flight from 
  the nest! I hope this helps! Don’t forget his host family can be of great benefit 
  as well, get to know them and the’ll help. Every family in our parents club

<P><font size="2">Losing one’s goal and purpose at the AFA is difficult for everyone 
  concerned to deal with. Motivation and commitment are the two most important 
  characteristics that a cadet must possess. Just wanting to fly does not make 
  an AF officer. This cadet needs to realize that the first year at the AFA is 
  unusual. Time discipline is extremely important. Graduates are sought after 
  and highly respected in the civilian community as well as the AF because of 
  the quality of their educaton.</font></P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=2>
<P><font size="2">From Cincinnati, OH</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">I didn’t decide to leave until my junior year (’81 had three 
  free years). I just walked back from class one day and announced to my friends 
  that I was gone. I wrote to several colleges and obtained applications. But 
  after speaking with my mom and several faculty members, I stayed and graduated. 
  Only one regret — My roommate and best friend used MY application to Notre Dame 
  and left the Aademy!! And did he ever enjoy telling me how much fun he was having 
  there.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I’d agree with the many others that these are normal feelings. 
  As far as sucking up to others, I too have found it to be worse in the corporate 
  world than in the Air Force.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Wow....does this bring back memories...</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I resigned, according to my diary, 29 times my doolie year. 
  I still have most of the forms too! And I can vividly, with the help of my diary, 
  remember the AOC’s reaction.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">"...C4C delivers forms to AOC...." pause here, he reads them.... 
  "Major Pittman: W—, what’s this? Resignation? I don’t think so. You’re just 
  upset or P.O.’d about something, aren’t you? Forget it...." (pause here for 
  sound of him ripping up the paperwork)"</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Why? He was a good judge of people; and could see I was just 
  "feeling down." This is the most normal thing in the world for the doolie. The 
  biggie; and so many have said it prior to me....LISTEN to your cadet. Understand 
  that this is a REALLY big challenge they’ve undertaken; not comparable to a 
  lot of things. Be there for them...don’t try to convince them to stay; it’s 
  up to them. If they truly want to leave, they’ll leave. If they don’t then they’ll 
  just talk about it, maybe write up the form once or twice, look at it, then 
  trash it. What I found most helpful was simply getting letters from family...just 
  about day-to-day things that I’d taken from granted but now missed terribly. 
  My brother is 12 years younger than I and I was soooo close to him. I missed 
  him terribly. I actually found that getting notes from him; in his "scribble" 
  were so good to my morale...I still have most of them; he doesn’t know it. One 
  day; and I don’t know when, I’ll give them to him. He just graduated from Univ 
  of Colorado...and I was there; as he was at my graduation.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">It’s not fun, early on. But it does get better; and there’s 
  so many good things to come...keep their spirits up; be there for them, and 
  support whatever decision they make. </font></P>

<P><font size="2">From Colorado Springs, CO (<I>this is excerpted from one that 
  came during Recognition</I>)</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">Hi parents:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">As I read some of your feelings regarding your kids at the Academy, 
  it brings back many memories from my time there as a 4 degree almost ten years 
  ago. I laugh about it now, but I’ll never forget the time that my parents allowed 
  their feelings of sorrow and helplessness for what I was going through get in 
  the way of their better judgement. I know that this story becomes more irrelevent 
  as your kids near Recognition, but I also remember that being a three degree 
  was only slightly easier than being a four degree.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Of course, like everyone else, I had my ups and downs during 
  my freshman year. For about three months I can remember there being all downs 
  and no ups. It was during that time that I would vent my frustration and unhappiness 
  to my parents, and unbeknownst to me, they wanted to do something about it. 
  Lo and behold, I walk into the squadron one day and my AOC wants to talk to 
  me. It turns out that dear old dad decided to take matters into his own hands 
  (he’s got a habit of doing that - retired Cheif of Police). He wanted to know 
  why the upperclassmen were giving me such a hard time, etc., etc.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">I can’t tell you how MAD I was at my dad for doing this. As 
  if I didn’t have enough to contend with, now I have to face the upper-class 
  cadets in my squadron just knowing what they were saying about me behind closed 
  doors. Nevermind the fact that dad wasn’t invited to fix these problems. The 
  problems were my own to fix.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">To make a long story short, it didn’t help matters at all. And 
  even if it had resulted in the upper-class laying off, I would not have wanted 
  them to because my "daddy" told on them. (As you can tell, I still hold some 
  resentment inside)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The moral of this story is this. Your kids didn’t make it to 
  the Academy because they lacked will and fortitude. And they certainly haven’t 
  made it this far if they haven’t refined that will and determination. I know 
  you all are concerned and share in the pain your kids are going through as cadets, 
  but the absolute best thing you can do for them is exactly what your’e doing 
  now. And that is just being there for them. Please don’t do what my parents 
  also did when I went home for Spring Break my freshman year. That is they let 
  me know that all I had to do was say the word and they would have my tuition 
  paid to our local state college there in our city. This was a let-down to me 
  again because it made me feel like they really beleived that I would want to 
  quit. I was baffled by that notion because I had never quit at anything before, 
  and as my own parents they should have known that better than anybody.....</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Dear ——,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Congratulate your cadet on being NORMAL!!!! EVERY normal cadet 
  wants to quit.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">1. Ask your cadet if he has the fortitude to finish the 1st 
  year so that he will have a full year of credit to transfer if he decides to 
  do that.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">2. Ask your cadet if he knows of ANY JOB where you do not have 
  to "suck up" to a superior. This is part of life. I know that our young people 
  are idealistic but there is very little difference in employee/superior relationship 
  in military and civilian life.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">3. Tell your cadet that it is okay to quit at the end of the 
  first year.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">4. Tell your cadet that it is okay to change his mind and decide 
  to stay AFTER deciding to quit.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">And From A Parent Whose Cadet Left the Academy</font></P>
</font></U><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=2>
<P><font size="2">From Council Bluffs, IA</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">To the —— and other concerned parents,</font></P>
<P><font size="2">We send our sons and daughters off to the Academy full of hopes 
  and dreams. They have put so much into getting an appointment, waited so long 
  (in some cases) to get the notice of appointment, and said some huge good byes...to 
  life as they knew it in their hometowns, to familiar surroundings, to families, 
  and most of all to "freedom".</font></P>
<P><font size="2">As parents, we put many hours of encouragement into discussions 
  about their future opportunities, experienced frustration, and come to the realization 
  that our child is soon to leave us, and has become an adult.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">So, it comes as a really painful event, when that son or daughter 
  calls or writes and says that the Academy isn’t what they had hoped for. Jon 
  and I can speak from first hand experience as our son Bart, choose to leave 
  the academy last January.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">He spent many hours anguishing over his decision and he did 
  not make it over night. Our hearts ached for him, as he had dreamed of going 
  to the Academy since he first attended an information meeting in his sophomore 
  year of high school. His desire was to be a pilot in the Air Force and get a 
  good solid education, serve in the Air Force, and eventually return to our farm. 
  He asked many questions of his liason officer several times when Tony (Now Major 
  Dunning) called or visited with Bart at the school. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">In the first semester, Bart did fairly well but was homesick 
  and realized that his life with his family would never be the same. He struggled 
  some in chemistry, mostly from mental blocks and stress. His squadron did extremely 
  well, and enjoyed a lot of extras because of that...those were the things that 
  I think got him through. That and lots of cards and letters from home. His father 
  and I sent something everyday...a package, a letter, I always sent E-mail as 
  well as articles from local papers and magazines. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">After he returned after the Holidays, he was distressed wth 
  2 events, one of which was the announcement that there were approximately 450 
  pilots slots reserved for his class, and second, that the Air Force would make 
  no guarantees beyond reserve commissions at graduation. Along with these there 
  were some minor events, that really made Bart stop and consider where he wanted 
  to go in the future.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">On the short term, he felt as tho he was letting every one down 
  that had helped him get his appointment. We tried to stress to him that they 
  did not ask for a guarantee from him that he would graduate from the Academy, 
  simply, they helped him try to reach one goal in life, an appointment. We also 
  reminded him that he was the person in this position not anyone else, nor could 
  he let his feelings that it was "expected" of him totally influence his decisions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">At this point, I would encourage you to let your son or daughter 
  totally vent their frustrations. That seems to be the most therapeutic benefit 
  on the short term. Encourage them to see a counselor and to talk to the faculty 
  as well. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Another point was made in one parent’s letter. This is part 
  of the education at the Academy...dealing with stress, taking flak, answering 
  to superiors with determination...this is how they decide to make it or choose 
  another path in Life.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Most importantly, tell that cadet that it is important to take 
  it one day at a time or even one hour at a time. Find some thing each day to 
  enjoy...a bit of quiet mischief, the comics, a walk with a fellow doolie, a 
  workout, they must learn to find little things to balance out their life for 
  this year. And remind them that it is just one year....and how quickly it can 
  go...just like their senior year of high school did!!!</font></P>
<P><font size="2">And for you parents, I know the feeling of desolation...you 
  can’t be there to support your cadet, you wish them happiness, and dreams come 
  true. Remember, that as hard as all this is, they will grow because of it, and 
  the paths they take are not always easy. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">Please, keep me informed. I would like to encourage all of you, 
  espcially the doolie parents, that this is a great time in your lives, WHATEVER 
  the outcome...watching those sons and daughters grow into fine, caring, men 
  and women.</font></P>

</u></B>
<P><font size="2">It’s been only a week since I reached out to you for help. And 
  did I get support. It’s been an emotional week. Eric was in a deep depression 
  for at least 3 weeks, most likely brought on by the midterm exams and grades. 
  He hasn’t learned yet how to steel from no-where, the time to study and sleep. 
  He has also been fighting losing himself to the regime. He has always been the 
  leader, instigator, full of pranks. He was the first in the class of ’99 to 
  do TOURS for a prank, which he is sort of proud of, actually. I don’t know why, 
  frankly. But the academic shock he was not prepared for-just can’t beleive it. 
  He theorizes that he could be making A’s anywhere else and get some sleep too, 
  so what is he doing there at the Academy? I know it’s normal to feel this way, 
  but he is so stressed out, he can’t see straight, much less think. I have been 
  sending e-mail every day and funny cards, I got THE BOOK at the academy gift 
  shop, which helped me a lot. and I had copied pages from it and sent to him, 
  as was suggested. He said that helped a bit. He did talk to 2 chaplains and 
  also to his AOC. Everyone told him to stick it out for at least the end of the 
  semester, the school year or even 2 years. At the same time he was also told 
  that it is his decision, that the military is not for everyone, etc. I forwarded 
  most all of your messages for me to him. (not the one with all the wonderful 
  sayings and wisdom, those I want to steel a few at a time!). He was frustrated 
  and argumentative to every suggestion from me at first, and I felt like I wasn’t 
  listening in his mind. But I did throw the decision back on him. I just asked 
  that he be sure that he was making the right one and to stick it out ‘til he 
  felt better. He didn’t want to hear it, so he asked for the papers to quit on 
  Monday. I didn’t hear any more ‘til today. I figured the e-mail was down again 
  or he was mad at me. This morning I received short e-mail: I’ve just been really 
  busy. I hardly even have time to read my mail. Well, I had the papers in my 
  hands, but somehow I couldn’t fill them out. It just didn’t feel right leaving 
  now. I told myself if I had any doubts I’ll stay. Everyone knows that I was 
  going to quit, but that doesn’t really matter. Thanksgiving is coming up soon, 
  so I’ll see you then. I’m not sure what made me change my mind, ‘cause I was 
  hard up on leaving, and as you probably know I can be stubborn. Guess that’s 
  life. Hu!" Something one of us wrote got through and I’m so happy for him that 
  he will complete a full something:semester, year, 2 years, a career, whatever. 
  Thank you all so very much. I’ve been so touched and moved to tears reading 
  your thoughtful messages. I hope this can help many more cadets and parents 
  cope with the stress the first year. I still can’t understand why they don’t 
  allow for enough sleep. But that’s another subject.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">(The following exchange took place after the original, but I

<P><font size="2">My name is —— proud Father of C3C ——. I read your post on the 
  AFnet. <I>(Your son)</I> sounds a little like our <I>(son)</I>. Last year he 
  struggled a great deal both Academically and Militarily. I think <I>(he)</I> 
  also was luckimg for "a good time". He seems to be into the concept of "fairness" 
  to an unreal degree. For various "really unfair" actions, he rarely got to leave 
  the Academy on weekends off and continually marched tours. He plays on the tennis 
  team and luckily, barely made his academic grade point average so that he could 
  travel with the team. I really believe that the team kept him from leaving. 
  He was VERY discouraged about being confined to campus on weekends. There was 
  not an e-mail correspondence with him where he didn’t threaten to come home! 
  My main advice to him was "don’t come home, your room is now your mom’s sewing 
  room" and "stay up there, it is just as easy to get a job at the Taco Bell in 
  Boulder as it is the one here in Houston". It was really hard to write him that 
  kind of stuff, but I think he needed a strong dose of reality and a list of 
  his real options at that time. As we have no military family ties, I think <I>our 
  son</I> suffers more than many guys up there who are "gung ho" sons of military 
  who have wanted to be up there since birth. Anyway, this year seems to be much 
  better for him. He still seems to get into trouble some but he is actually enjoying 
  some of his courses! After they get recognized in May, things really change 
  for them... if they can just hang in! </font></P>
<P><font size="2">It is a very rough go for them, especially when they talk to 
  their high school buddies at "regular" colleges... all the women,parties, and 
  of course NO ONE HAS TO STUDY, YOU JUST DRINK BEER, etc. I am very proud of 
  <I>our son</I> for getting this far. He will have a MAJOR decision as to whether 
  to start his third year... and I have NO idea as to what he will do!! Hope this 
  helps some. Good luck to <I>(your son)</I>!</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Just a quick comment regarding the need for "hard advice" to 
  cadets that want to come home. I agree that it’s important to not encourage 
  our kids to quit and come home, but it’s even worst to imply that there is no 
  longer any home to return to. Hanging out the "not welcome" sign by the parents 
  of a doolie in the class of ’96 (back in 1992) resulted in the cadet’s attempted 
  suicide. He jumped out the top floor window of his squadron area. It didn’t 
  kill him, but now he is paralysed for life. I only hope those parents did finally 
  take him back into their home. This is information I received second-hand, and 
  of course it should be considered accordingly. The point, however, is still 
  very relevant.</font></P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P><font size="2">It is a very relevant and freightening point! It is abhorrent 
  to think that a parent could absolutely close the door on a child in this situation! 
  My letter is somewhat misleading.... I believe that <I>(my son)</I> really didn’t 
  want to come home to this house, he wanted to "come home" to friends,sleeping 
  in,staying out late, a car etc....a continuance of the life of a high-school-star-senior. 
  A lifestyle which, outside of <I>(my son’s)</I> mind, no longer existed! There 
  was continuous e-mail conversation as to his alternatives if he indeed left 
  the Academy. It was NEVER a matter of self esteem or the lack of self esteem 
  for not "makng it" at the Academy. It was (and I suppose still is) a matter 
  of whether a child from a "liberal" household could exist in a military atmosphere. 
  It is the ultimate problem of why anyone would subject themselves to the rigors 
  of a military academy when there are so many more pleasant alternatives. We 
  continually advised <I>(my son)</I> to speak to councilors or upperclassmen 
  about his situation. As most of the Cadets seem to have very similar credentials, 
  surely, he was not the first or only Cadet to have negative feelings. The incident 
  that you wrote of suggests to me that there SHOULD BE some very easy way at 
  the Academy for doolies to discuss their problems. I agree that parents are 
  often NOT the best source of guidance! Perhaps someone has information on such 
  channels of communication at The Academy.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Highlights of comments and advice presented by Major Scott Dering 
  ('81) to Class of '99 on June 11.1995. Major Dering is an active Air Force Officer 
  on leave to Kansas University to acquire his Doctorate Degree - he will then 
  return to the Academy to teach. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">The Academy experience is TOUGH-especially when you’re doing 
  two things at once:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <P><font size="2">1)&#9; You’re leaving behind family, friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, 
    and a familiar environment - more painfully you’re leaving behind your CHILDHOOD.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">2)&#9;Academy success requires STAMINA above all - tortoises, 
    not hares, win the race.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">3)&#9; It doesn’t require extraordinary brains, strength, 
    or courage - you’ve all demonstrated that you have enough of these to make 
    it -just requires sticking with it when things seem rough - not giving up. 
    </font></P>
</DIR>
<P><font size="2">There are several ways of thinking that might lighten your load:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <P><font size="2">1)&#9;The childhoods of your friends are over too - they may 
    not figure this out quite as soon as you do since it’s easier for them to 
    call home.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">2) &#9;Those students going to civilian schools that are doing 
    well are those that are studying hard, working hard, making sacrifices - they 
    are not those that write you about the great parties they are having at their 
    school.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">3)&#9; Remember that 28,000 people have already graduated 
    from USAFA - are they tougher than you?</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">4) &#9;Then think of the BILLIONS of young people who would 
    gladly trade places with you - this thought may not be too persuasive since 
    they are so far removed from you. </font></P>
  <P><font size="2">5)&#9;Think of a more specific group that would like to trade 
    places with you-those that applied but didn’t get accepted. I read that Capt. 
    O’Grady wanted to go to the Academy but didn’t get in. I’m fairly sure a guy 
    like him could have made it. How can you afford to leave early when the alternate 
    would probably have made it all the way? </font></P>
</DIR>
<P><font size="2">Another thing to always keep in mind is that you’re not alone 
  - there are at least 3 groups pulling for you at all times - you’re sort of 
  the tip of the arrow. These are:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <P><font size="2">1) &#9;People at home - parents, relatives, teachers, counselors, 
    coaches, neighbors, people at your church, etc.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">2) &#9;Academy classmates - within hours you’ll build comradeships 
    - pull together - want each other to do well. You’ll develop the closest bonds 
    you’ll ever had outside your immediate family.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">3) &#9;USAFA staff and upper classmates - sometimes you may 
    not think so when you are getting intense training - but they want you to 
    stay and do well. These all create momentum to keep you going. </font></P>
</DIR>
<P><font size="2">Some say to take Academy life day by day, but I advise you to 
  lengthen your horizons. Life as a cadet continually improves and then as an 
  officer, it gets even better:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <P><font size="2">1) &#9;The academic year is better than BCT (basic training).</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">2) &#9;Sophomore year is better than the Freshman year.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">3) &#9;Junior and Senior years - much improved over the sophomore 
    year.</font></P>
  <P><font size="2">4) &#9;And then life as an officer is terrific - the pay isn’t 
    bad either - $25,000 as a 2nd Lt. and $40,000+ four years later.</font></P>
</DIR>
<P><font size="2">5) Until at my age you’re so deliriously happy you can hardly 
  wipe the smile off your face. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">By your acceptance into the Academy, you’ve already proved you 
  have what it takes to make it. I wish you great success in this new challenge.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="2">What’s expected of Air Force people</font></P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Baskerton" SIZE=1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="2">by Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman</font></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="2">Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;WASHINGTON (AFNS) — Lately, there’s been a lot of discussion 
  about the renewed emphasis on standards and accountability within our Air Force, 
  to include the concern that we’re fast becoming a one-mistake Air Force.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;I want to help set the record straight on these issues by 
  providing you my perspective on what we expect of Air Force people.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Let me say at the outset that the senior leadership realizes 
  that our people are the strength of the Air Force. It’s the outstanding active 
  duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian members of our team who make us the most respected 
  air and space force in the world. You are the foundation of the combat capability 
  that we provide the nation and its theater commanders to defend America’s security 
  interests around the world.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;As a group, you are the best educated, most motivated, most 
  innovative people we’ve ever had in uniform. Many have stayed with us through 
  the turmoil of demobilization, restructure, base closures, and mission realignments. 
  We’re fortunate to have all of you on our team.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;I’m particularly proud of how you’ve stepped up to the increased 
  pace of contingency operations driven by the unstable post-Cold War environment. 
  When our nation has called, you’ve responded magnificently — to relieve human 
  suffering, to demonstrate American resolve, to compel rogue regimes to comply 
  with United Nations mandates, to force warring parties to cease hostilities 
  and to enforce tenuous peace accords. In doing so, you’ve earned the praise 
  and respect of theater commanders and national leaders alike.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;On the other hand, we’ve seen a number of indications that 
  in all the Services, we have accessed people who don’t understand the unique 
  requirements of our military profession. In my view, it is critical that all 
  Air Force members know and understand these requirements. The fact of the matter 
  is that the Air Force exists to fight and win America’s wars. We are entrusted 
  with the security of our great nation in a still-dangerous world. The tools 
  of our trade are lethal. We engage in operations that involve risk to human 
  life and national treasure. And we all have voluntarily taken an oath to support 
  and defend the Constitution of the United States.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Now, because of what we do, our standards must be higher 
  than those that prevail in society at large. The American people expect this 
  of us, and properly so. In the end, our behavior must continue to merit their 
  trust, their respect, and their support.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;So, it’s imperative that Air Force commanders and supervisors 
  ensure their troops understand the requirements of our military profession — 
  and measure up to them. Together, we must insist on disciplined and principled 
  behavior by our troops. When an individual fails to meet the higher standards 
  expected of military professionals, then we must hold him or her accountable, 
  and document the offense in their records.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;We must also be consistent in our disciplinary and personnel 
  actions concerning such individuals. If an officer receives a letter of reprimand, 
  then I would not expect to see a fire-walled Officer Performance Report covering 
  the time frame when the LOR was administered. Nor would I expect a decoration 
  or choice assignment to immediately follow that LOR.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;In the end, ours is not a "have it your way" kind of air 
  force. Service members cannot be allowed to pick and choose which aspects of 
  Air Force standards, Air Force Instructions, Department of Defense directives, 
  or the Uniform Code of Military Justice they will comply with. That would undermine 
  the good order and discipline that’s so crucial to any fighting outfit.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;I will tell you straight out that if you are unwilling to 
  comply with Air Force standards, to embrace the values of our profession, to 
  meet the unique requirements of military service or to accept the resulting 
  limits on individual behavior, then you need to get out of the Air Force.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Our responsibility for safeguarding America is far too important 
  — it’s just too critical — for us to allow it to be jeopardized by those who 
  are unwilling to measure up to the profession of arms. I’m convinced, though, 
  that those individuals in our service who fall into this category are few in 
  number.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Instead, the vast majority of Air Force people are dedicated 
  professionals who strive to live up to our service’s core values. </font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;They understand that integrity is essential in a military 
  organization where we count on fellow members to do their part, and that honesty 
  is the glue that binds the members of an outfit into a cohesive team. Air Force 
  professionals realize that the purpose of our profession is too important for 
  its practitioners to violate tech data, to pencil-whip training requirements 
  or to falsify documents. They readily take responsibility for their actions, 
  and exhibit the courage to do the "right" thing. In the end, they always exhibit 
  the utmost in principled behavior, off-duty as well as on.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Air Force professionals place service before self. They 
  willingly subordinate personal interests for the good of their unit, the Air 
  Force, and the nation. They also embrace what Gen. Sir John Hackett has called 
  the "unlimited liability clause" associated with our military profession. That 
  is, if called upon to do so, they are willing to risk their lives in defense 
  of our nation, its democratic values, and its citizens.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Furthermore, professionals in our service strive to excel 
  in all that they do. They understand that our responsibility for America’s security 
  carries with it the moral imperative to seek excellence in all our military 
  activities. So, they work hard to develop their skills, and seek to become the 
  very best at what they do. They routinely give their all to each and every task 
  — no matter how small or seemingly insignificant — because that’s the way of 
  the professional.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;In recent months, there has been growing concern over the 
  perceived development of a "one-mistake Air Force". I will tell you that those 
  individuals who strive to do it right; who seek to be dedicated Air Force professionals 
  — day in and day out — need not be concerned about a "one-mistake Air Force," 
  because it doesn’t exist for them.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;Air Force leaders understand that their people will make 
  honest mistakes in the course of their military endeavors. These mistakes are 
  a normal part of our people gaining experience as they grow and progress in 
  their careers. When they commit honest mistakes, our troops must acknowledge 
  them, take the necessary corrective action and then press on.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;On the other hand, when an individual exhibits personal 
  negligence, misbehavior or disobedience, that is not a mistake—it’s a crime. 
  And crimes are matters of serious concern for superiors. Thus, if a service 
  member willfully ignores Air Force standards, falsifies reports, disobeys a 
  superior, engages in inappropriate off-duty behavior or the like, then we must 
  immediately take the appropriate disciplinary action. For such an individual, 
  our Service may well become a "one-offense Air Force".</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;In the end, it’s the responsibility of our commanders and 
  supervisors in the field to sort all this out. They must deal with individuals 
  on a case by case basis. A commander’s loyalty to an individual, who does not 
  demonstrate loyalty to the Air force as an institution, is misplaced and is 
  wrong. I count on commanders to do the right thing.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">&#9;As we approach the dawn of the 21st century, I am convinced 
  it will be the century of aerospace power. It will be an exciting time for our 
  Air Force as the air and space capabilities we provide the nation grow in importance. 
  I am confident that our dedicated professionals will continue to provide the 
  American people the kind of Air Force they deserve — a ready, innovative, and 
  disciplined force with a set of values and standards that make us all proud 
  to serve.</font></P>
