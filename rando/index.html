            First Class Dennis P. Rando lost his life in a flight training accident 
            on September 30, 1996. He is the son of Paul and Toni Rando of East 
            Bridgewater, MA, and the brother of Denise Rando. Paul and Toni 
            were members of the AF Academy Cadet Parents' Association of Eastern 
            Massachusetts. Dennis' Instructor Pilot, Capt. Clay Smith, lost 
            his life in the accident as well. Tragically, two other cadets and 
            their Air Force flight instructors also lost their lives in separate 
            flight trainer accidents at the Academy in 1995 - Cadet Mark Dostal 
            and his Instructor Pilot, Capt. Dan Fischer and in 1997 - Cadet 
            Pace Weber and his Instructor Pilot, Capt. Glenn Comeaux. (<a href="http://www.falconpride.com/t3/" class="links">http://www.falconpride.com/t3/</a>) </font></p>
            <p align="left" class="randobody"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dennis 
              was an admirable and well-liked Cadet. Those who knew him were very 
              impressed by his friendliness, willingness to help others, generosity, 
              and his compassion. Dennis is described by many as &quot;the epitome 
              of a cadet.&quot; His passion was to fly. <br />
              <br />
              Former AFA Cadet Parents' Association of Eastern Massachusetts President, 
              Bob Caggiano, founded the Rando Fund. Bob was inspired to create 
              the Fund as a way to reimburse a number of Dennis' cadet classmates 
              who came to Massachusetts to attend Dennis' funeral to serve as 
              a cadet Honor Guard after learning that the cadets had traveled 
              at their own personal expense. Bob would also learn that the Academy 
              does not have the financial resources to provide for this type of 
              travel for a cadet Honor Guard. The Massachusetts Association made 
              an appeal to other cadet parents and Cadet Parents' Associations 
              to help reimburse these cadets for their travel by making a donation. 
              The response from across the country was overwhelming and more money 
              that what was needed was donated. The Cadet Parents Club of Eastern 
              Massachusetts then decided that fund raising to provide this type 
              of travel was a most worthwhile endeavor for all cadets, their families 
              and the AF Academy, as well as way to honor Dennis' memory. The 
              Academy Superintendent at that time, General Paul Stein, recognized 
              the value of this effort in support of the cadets and the Academy 
              and worked to assist in the Rando Fund becoming a national fund 
              raising initiative with a committee comprised of cadet parents and 
              Cadet Parent Associations throughout the USA. The Air Force and 
              the Academy fully supports the Fund and have officially recognized 
              it and its mission. The Fund remains viable due to the continued 
              donations of many individuals and the fund raising efforts of Parents' 
              Associations from across the country. Since the Fund's inception, 
              approximately $267,000 has been raised and spent in support of cadets 
              and their families.</font></p>
		<p align="left" class="randobody"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Fund's primary purpose is to help finance travel so that a group 
              of about six cadets can attend the funeral services of a fellow 
              cadet. The fund continually maintains a $10,000 reserve of its total 
              assets for this purpose. Enabling the cadets to participate in the 
              funeral service of a fellow cadet accomplishes two things. It helps 
              cadets during an emotional time to say a final good-bye to their 
              very close friend and it helps support the family involved when 
              they see and meet a contingent of cadets who were closest to their 
              son or daughter. The cadets also serve as the representatives of 
              all other cadets and cadet families at the hometown services. Cadets 
              are not asked to repay these funds. The funds are a gift made possible 
              by the generous donations of people like you.</font></p>
            <p align="left" class="randobody"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
              funds beyond the reserve are earmarked for humanitarian purposes 
              such as enabling cadets of limited financial means to be able to 
              travel home to attend the funeral services for a family member, 
              close relative or close friend; or, to visit a very ill or seriously 
              injured family member, close relative or friend based on the recommendations 
              of a cadet's AOC, the Cadet Chaplain's Office or Commandant's Office. 
              Cadet eligibility regarding necessity of travel, as well as determining 
              the cadet's financial need is the responsibility of the Chaplain's 
              Office. Not even the President of the Rando Fund is involved in 
              that process. It has always been the opinion of the Fund's leadership 
              that those decisions are best left to those most closely involved 
              with the cadets and have the expertise necessary to determine a 
              cadet's level of personal, emotional and financial need. Based on 
              those recommendations, the Fund will subsidize the cost of the travel. 
              The cadet and their family are not required to reimburse the fund. 
              Again, these funds are a gift made possible by your donations.</font></p>
            <p align="left" class="randobody"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br />
              The Air Force Academy Superintendents, Commandants and Chaplains 
              have continually expressed their support and appreciation of this 
              Fund because it fills a void at the Academy that is not a part of 
              their budget, nor is transportation for such situations offered 
              through the Air Force. Many officials at the Academy continue to 
              be impressed with the ability of the parents to organize and help 
              the cadets at a time of emotional need. The letters of sincere appreciation 
              received from families who have lost a cadet as well as the letters 
              of thanks from cadets who have been able to attend the funeral of 
              a fallen comrade or be at the bedside of critically ill family member 
              or friend, speaks to the need for us to continue this most worthwhile 
              work. </font></p>
            <p align="left" class="randobody"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Fund supports any cadet in need, not just the cadets whose families 
              or Parents' Associations have made contributions. The Rando Fund 
              has no affiliation with any other fund raising groups or organizations 
              and has no other missions other than to raise funds on behalf of 
              cadets for the purposes stated above. 100% of every donation received 
              goes into the Fund. The Fund has no paid staff nor does it have 
              any expenses related to its operation. The cost of all expenses 
              is donated.</font></p>
