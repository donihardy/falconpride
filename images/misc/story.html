AIRCRAFT DAMAGE, F-15C (80-0024), 33 FW, EGLIN AFB, FL, 5 NOV. A 96th Security 
Forces Squadron Chevrolet Lumina collided with a parked F-15 from the 58th Fighter 
Squadron causing damage to the left main landing gear area. The driver of the 
vehicle, an Amn, has a laceration to his head requiring stitches and is undergoing 
further observation for a possible concussion. The passenger in the vehicle and 
a crew chief climbing the boarding ladder were treated for slight injuries and 
released. The vehicle is a total loss as the roof had to be cut off to remove 
it from underneath the aircraft. The vehicle doors had to be cut off in order 
to get the occupants out. The aircraft has been impounded to inspect for structural 
damage and possible cracks. There is no dollar estimate for damage to the F-15 
and local media attention is expected. Further reporting will be through Security 
Forces, Safety, and Maintenance channels.
